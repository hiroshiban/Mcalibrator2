1. Add an option to select a directory to save the measurement results.

2. Add different subroutine to display a color patch.
   Mcalibrator now has three options to display color patch for display calibration.
   One is MATLAB-native figure, the second is Psychtoolbox drawing, and the third is CRS BITS++
   with Psychtoolbox (not tested). We need to add another subroutine that uses some of ViSage's
   drawing functions to directly interact with ViSaGe stimulus presentation environment.

3. An interface to ColorCAL through a virtual serial port
   To use Mcalibrator on Mac OSX, another version of function for Mcalibrator to interact with
   ColorCAL through a virtual serial port will be required.

4. The other interfaces to CRS light measurement devices.
   We need to add/update some class files in ~/Mcalibrator2/subfunctions/colorimeter/
   to use OptiCAL, ColorCAL, and SpectroCAL in Mcalibrator2.
