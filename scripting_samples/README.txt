****************************************

Almost all the display characterization steps of Mcalibrator2 are provided as individual MATLAB function forms and
almost all sub-functions are located in ~/Mcalibrator2/subfunctions directory. The main Mcalibrator2.m function
just provides the GUI-based interfaces to these sub-routines (though it actually provides some of data displaying,
manipulating, and storing procedures too). Therefore, you can easily extract a part of the procedures implemented
in Mcalibrator2 and use it in your own characterization procedures.

In this directory, I will put some example MATLAB codes to show how we can use the sub-routines of Mcalibrator2.
Hope these samples can help your daily display calibration and research projects.
