function J=mat2json(M,F)

%JSON2MAT converts a Matlab structure into a javascript data object (JSON).
%         M can also be a file name. In the spirit of fast prototyping 
%         this function takes a very loose approach to data types and 
%         dimensionality - neither is explicitly retained.
%
%         The second input argument is optional and when used it indicates
%         the name of the file where J is to be stored.
%
%Example: mat2json(json2mat('{lala:2,lele:4,lili:[1,2,{bubu:5}]}'))
